## Problem/Solution Tweets

**Tweet 7:**
Most journaling apps are bloated with features you don't need, subscriptions you can't afford, and privacy policies you should fear.

We built the opposite. Free, private, and focused on one thing: helping you write.

**Tweet 8:**
You don't need AI prompts. You don't need mood trackers. You don't need cloud sync.

You just need a place to write your thoughts without distractions.

That's what we built.

**Tweet 9:**
Ever started journaling, only to abandon it because the app was too complicated?

We get it. That's why our app has no setup, no account creation, and no tutorials. Just open and start writing.
